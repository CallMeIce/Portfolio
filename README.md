# Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to build my own portfolio using the knowledge I have in HTML and in CSS. I built this project to see my starting point in my new career and see what I can come up with later on once I'm more fluent in these languages and learn others! This doesn't really solve any problems but, in a sense it made me think of more solutions and try to solve them on my own or ask peers and research more about that specific topic. Once I solved it, I was able to incorporate it again but, this time with more ease.
