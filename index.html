        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p id="me">
          Some things about me are that I am a good team player and can adapt my personality very easily to get along with people when working on a project. It's nice when you have a group to bounce ideas, check over each others work and even just make new friends along the way. 
          When it comes working alone. I usually am really dedicated to working on the project and put all of my focus on the project. Occasional breaks here and there but, I always want to present the best project I'm able to give. Outside of work, I have many hobbies like fishing,
          playing sports, gaming, and even playing some chess.
